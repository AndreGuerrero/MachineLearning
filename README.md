INTRO:

A collection of Matlab scripts that implement different Machine Learning Algorithms.

These applications were created during the graduate class EE565 - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, taught by Dr. De Leon on Fall 2014 at New Mexico State University. 

The algorithms used different techniques such asd Bayes theorem, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Relevant Vector Machine, and Neural Net.
